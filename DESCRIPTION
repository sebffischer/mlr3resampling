Description: A supervised learning algorithm inputs a train set,
 and outputs a prediction function, which can be used on a test set.
 If each data point belongs to a group
 (such as geographic region, year, etc), then
 how do we know if it is possible to train on one group, and predict
 accurately on another group? Cross-validation can be used to determine
 the extent to which this is possible, by first assigning fold IDs from
 1 to K to all data (possibly using stratification, usually by group
 and label). Then we loop over test sets (group/fold combinations),
 train sets (same group, other groups, all groups), and compute
 test/prediction accuracy for each combination.  Comparing
 test/prediction accuracy between same and other, we can determine the
 extent to which it is possible (perfect if same/other have similar
 test accuracy for each group; other is usually somewhat less accurate
 than same; other can be just as bad as featureless baseline when the
 groups have different patterns).
