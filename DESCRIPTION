Description: A supervised learning algorithm inputs a train set,
 and outputs a prediction function, which can be used on a test set.
 If each data point belongs to a group (such as geographic region,
 year, etc), then how do we know if it is possible to train on
 one group, and predict accurately on another group?
 Cross-validation can be used to determine the extent to which
 this is possible, by first assigning fold IDs from 1 to K to all
 data (possibly using stratification, usually by group and label).
 Then we loop over test sets (image/fold combinations),
 train sets (same group, other groups, all groups),
 and compute test/prediction accuracy for each combination.
 Comparing test/prediction accuracy between same and other,
 we can determine the extent to which it is possible
 (perfect if same/other have similar test accuracy for each group,
 other is usually somewhat less accurate than same,
 worst case is that other is just as bad as featureless baseline).
